WarHamachi
================

WarHamachi lets you find Warcraft 3:TFT games over Hamachi that you previously could not because of its subnet problems. 

Allowing you to choose the host with the best connection or just find your friend's games that were previously unaccessible. 

It also lets you use the more recent Hamachi versions, tested with 1.0.3.0.

How to:
----------------------
* Start WarHamachi 2.4.
* WarHamachi will update itself if a new version is available.
* Windows Firewall might prompt you asking if you want to let WarHamachi 2.4 through, you must accept this for it to work.
* Enter Warcraft 3 and go to Lan Games.
* For a manual game request, double click on the WarHamachi icon in the system tray.

Game Monitor
-----------------------
This feature will show you a balloon tip in the system tray when it finds a game or the number of players update. 
Great for when you are alt-tabbed waiting for a game to fill up. 
The popups can be disabled from the right-click menu.
